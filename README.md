# C++ Modules

This repository contains the solutions for the C++ Modules project series from the 42 curriculum. The C++ Modules are designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including object-oriented programming, memory management, and more advanced features of the language.

Each module focuses on different aspects of C++, helping students to gradually build their skills and understanding of the language.

## Modules

This repository is divided into several modules, each covering a specific topic:

1. **Module 00**: Introduction to C++ and basic syntax.
2. **Module 01**: Memory allocation, references, and pointers.
3. **Module 02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Form.
4. **Module 03**: Inheritance and abstract classes.
5. **Module 04**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
6. **Module 05**: Repetition and nested classes.
7. **Module 06**: C++ casts.
8. **Module 07**: Templates.
9. **Module 08**: Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms.
10. **Module 09**: Understanding the STL (Standard Template Library) and advanced C++ algorithms.

Each module is located in its own directory and contains a README explaining the module's objectives, the tasks, and how to compile and run the exercises.

## Installation

To compile and run the examples provided in these modules, you'll need a C++ compiler (g++ recommended) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mariusz-smajdor/cpp_modules.git
    cd cpp_modules
    ```

2. **Navigate to the module:**
    ```sh
    cd module-00
    ```

3. **Compile the project:**
    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Usage

Each module comes with exercises that demonstrate specific C++ features. You can compile and run each exercise individually.

```sh
./exercise_name
```

This will run the first exercise in the module and display the output based on the specific exercise requirements.
